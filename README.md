Based on my observation, we are given a small data set which can not be used to apply deep learning and neural networks.

However, here I have listed the algorithms that we can try and find the best result. We should start early to be able to try all of them or at least most of them. Good news is that there are lots of tutorials with ready codes on the internet which saves much time from us like the one I have put for SVM.
Each of us can pick an area, either regression or classification, and start to experiment until the end of this month. Then, we can merge our results and start to write the report together.

For task 1, possible solutions could be:

1. Polynomial regression
2. Suport vector regression
3. Decision tree regression 
4. Random forest regresion

Also for task 2 these algorithms can be used:

1. Logestic regression
2. KNN
3. Support vector machine [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8D5YL6cOSE)
4. Naive Bayes
5. Decision tree classification
6. Random forest classification
7. Kernel SVM

### TODO ###

1. Pre-processing the data has shown a significant improvement on performance. So we might start with some pre-processing. I try to do it by the end of this week. So, we can do rest of the experiments with pre-processed data. I will also put the steps that I have done for pre-processing.
2. Implement and compare the results of the algorithms and pick the best ones to win the competition. :D
